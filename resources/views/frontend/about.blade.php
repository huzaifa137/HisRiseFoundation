                        Formally known as the Ishak Community Foundation, HisRise Foundation was registered in
                        2021 as a community-based organisation in Jinja District, Uganda. Founded by Isiko Isaac,
                        HisRise exists to restore dignity and opportunity to boys and young men who are often
                        overlooked in development efforts.

                    <p class="pb-4 text-justify">
                        Our mission is to empower boys through education, skills development, mentorship, and
                        leadership training. We believe that when boys are guided to make responsible choices,
                        strengthen their resilience, and embrace positive masculinity, they rise not only for themselves
                        but also for their families and communities

                        helping boys re-enter school and receive career guidance. Future Skills Lab and the Innovation
                        & Enterprise Hub promote SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth by equipping boys
                        with vocational and entrepreneurial skills. Resilience & Expression and the Safe Choices
                        Campaign strengthen SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being, including mental health and
                        reproductive health, while Positive Masculinity & Leadership advances SDG 5: Gender
                        Equality by challenging harmful norms
