                <p class="text-uppercase text-center text-primary display-5">HisRise Foundation</p>

                <p class="pb-4 text-justify">
                    Formally known as the Ishak Community Foundation, HisRise Foundation was registered in
                    2021 as a community-based organisation in Jinja District, Uganda. Founded by Isiko Isaac,
                    HisRise exists to restore dignity and opportunity to boys and young men who are often
                    overlooked in development efforts.
                </p>

                <p class="pb-4 text-justify">
                    Our mission is to empower boys through education, skills development, mentorship, and
                    leadership training. We believe that when boys are guided to make responsible choices,
                    strengthen their resilience, and embrace positive masculinity, they rise not only for themselves
                    but also for their families and communities
                </p>

                <p class="pb-4 text-justify">
                    Every program we run is aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
                    (SDGs). Education ReStart and Campus Compass advance SDG 4: Quality Education by
                    helping boys re-enter school and receive career guidance. Future Skills Lab and the Innovation
                    & Enterprise Hub promote SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth by equipping boys
                    with vocational and entrepreneurial skills. Resilience & Expression and the Safe Choices
                    Campaign strengthen SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being, including mental health and
                    reproductive health, while Positive Masculinity & Leadership advances SDG 5: Gender
                    Equality by challenging harmful norms
                </p>

                <p class="pb-4 text-justify">
                    Beyond individual empowerment, HisRise also drives community transformation. Community
                    Impact Corps and the Rights & Responsibility Academy contribute to SDG 16: Peace, Justice,
                    and Strong Institutions by fostering civic responsibility and justice awareness. Green Futures
                    Initiative advances SDG 13: Climate Action and SDG 15: Life on Land through environmental
                    stewardship, while Global Horizons prepares boys for digital literacy and international
                    opportunities, strengthening SDG 17: Partnerships for the Goals.
                </p>

                <p class="pb-4 text-justify">At HisRise, we see boys not as problems to be fixed but as leaders to
                    be nurtured. By aligning
                    our vision with the SDGs, we ensure that every boy rises with dignity, resilience, and purpose
                    — contributing to a more just, sustainable, and inclusive world.
